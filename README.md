S3 Dashboard is a Laravel-based starter kit designed for rapid application development with built-in roles and permissions, user management, and authentication features. This kit also provides essential middleware and multi-SMTP support, allowing a secure and scalable environment out-of-the-box.

## Features

### Authentication & User Management

-   **User Registration, Login, Password Reset, Forgot Password, and Email Verification**.
-   **Roles & Permissions**: Easily manage roles and permissions, thanks to [Spatie Laravel Permissions](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/).
-   **Three Default Roles**: `superadmin`, `developer`, and `tester` with unrestricted route access.

### Middleware

1. **Auth Middleware**: Secure routes with user authentication.
2. **Lock Middleware**: Lock usersâ€™ accounts when idle to prevent unauthorized access. Users can unlock by re-entering their password.
3. **Active Middleware**: Control access based on user activity status. New users are inactive by default and user can activate and verify their account from email link, but admins can activate/inactivate users and this will automatically log out on their next action.
4. **Verify Middleware**: Require email verification before granting account access. This is enabled by default for quick access but can be enabled/disabled via the **Authentication Settings**
5. **Locale Middleware**: Allows users to manage language settings. Currently, only English is supported. Contributions for other languages are welcome!

### SMTP & Email Settings

-   **Multi-SMTP Support**: Configure multiple SMTP servers to ensure failover support. If the default server fails, the system will attempt to send emails through other configured SMTP servers.
-   **ObserverServiceProvider**: Manage all observers from one place.
-   **PolicyServiceProvider**: Customize policy registration in cases where the model and policy names do not match.

### General Settings

Easily configure:

-   Application settings, including App Name, URL, Site URL, and Timezone.
-   Logo settings (Main Logo, Favicon, Light Theme Logo, Dark Theme Logo).
-   Authentication settings Email Verification (Enable/Disable) for new account registrations.
-   Email settings, such as Default Sending Email.

### Additional Functionalities

-   **Client & Staff Management**: Manage client and staff data in a single table, eliminating the need for multiple models.
-   **Customizable Middleware**: The `UserObserver` class can be used to customize user behaviors like activation and verification post-installation.
-   **Social Login**: Currently supported Github but in future Google and Facebook will be added Thanks to [Laravel Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/socialite)
